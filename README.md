# Chrome extension

This extension currently does not support anything but connectordb.com

Pull requests will happily be accepted making it compatible with self-hosted servers.

The extension is available from the chrome web store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/connectordb-chrome-logger/nekbpbloplgnhgfknjaebahdjnabaclf
